# Audio Super-Resolution Using GANs and ViT
## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing audio resolution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of increasing the quality of low-resolution audio samples, effectively reconstructing high-resolution audio from its low-resolution counterpart.
